            Itachi Uchiha (Japanese: うちは イタチ Hepburn: Uchiha Itachi) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and
            anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha and is responsible
            for killing all the members of their clan, sparing only Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the
            organization Akatsuki and serves as the biggest threat to his brother. During the second part of the manga,
            Itachi becomes involved in terrorist attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast creatures until facing Sasuke
            in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel, it is later revealed Itachi had a
            secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi has been featured in the Naruto films, has appeared
            once in an original video animation of Naruto, and is a playable character in most of the video games from
            the series
        </p>
        <p>
            Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a prodigy of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan that served as an Anbu
            Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger
            brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose
            activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke — who sought to
            avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
            complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village,
            remaining a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga, and has been positively received by
            critics. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some have considered
            his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story
            has also received positive reception, and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the
            series.Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including
            keychains, plush dolls and figurines.

                Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha. His early childhood was marked with
                violence:
                when he was four years old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand many of the
                war's
                casualties. The death and destruction he experienced at such a young age traumatised Itachi and made him
                a
                pacifist, leading to him training non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja in order
                to erase fighting from the world. At age 5, after becoming a big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was
                approached
                by Shisui, who offered to train together. Soon, the two became best friends, forming a brother-like bond
                as
                they continued to teach the other new tricks. During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, he was home
                alone
                looking after Sasuke, followed by Itachi rescuing Mikoto from falling debris, and in the anime seeking
                shelter with Izumi.

                alt="a picture of itachi holding baby sauske during nine tails attack">
            <p>
                Nine-Tails' attack had soured relations between Konoha's leadership and the
                Uchiha, the former believing the latter to be responsible. The Uchiha were relocated to the edge of the
                village, isolating them from the rest of the village and making it easier to monitor them.
            </p>
            <p>
                At age six, Itachi enrolled into the Academy, where he consistently scored the highest in each subject
                and
                quickly learned any skill taught to him, resulting in him being praised as the best of his
                generation.
                After
                four months, his teachers unanimously agreed let him take the graduation exam early due to Itachi being
                more
                than advanced enough for genin-level, which he passed later that month.During this time, he began
                seriously
                studying the history of the world, gaining a great appreciation for it. On the day he graduated as the
                youngest
                post-war graduate, he was approached by Danzō Shimura, who assessed Itachi's thinking.

            </p>
            <p>
                Joining Team 2, Itachi went on to honing his skills to chūnin level, leading to him drawing the
                attention of Konoha's leaders. Meeting the criteria, Fugaku allowed him to sit in on clan meetings in
                the Naka Shrine basement.Nearly a year since graduating, Itachi had mastered ninjutsu to the extent
                his missions went to easy, though Yūki Minazuki didn't recommend him for the Chūnin Exams. After turning
                eight, as Team 2's genin had distinguished themselves the most during the year, they were tasked with
                guarding the Fire Daimyō during his annual trip to Konoha. During the mission, the convoy was attacked
                by a masked individual, who killed Tenma Izumo before Itachi, resulting in him awakening his Sharingan,
                which he mastered at the same age.At age 10, Konoha officials allowed Itachi to compete in the
                Chūnin Exams by himself, which he passed and became a chūnin.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                At age 11, he entered the Anbu. Itachi's accomplishments were a source of great pride for his
                family, his father viewing him as proof of the Uchiha's future prosperity and his brother viewing him as
                a model to live up to. Itachi spent a great deal of time with Sasuke, training with him (though rarely
                actually training him) and giving him the recognition their father did not. However, for all the
                attention he received, few truly understood Itachi,believing his isolation to be a result of the
                gap between his abilities and theirs and not his dissatisfaction with the shinobi's life of conflict.
                Eventually, the Uchiha's disdain for their unfair treatment led them to plan a coup d'état. Fugaku, head
                of the Uchiha and the coup's chief conspirator, encouraged Itachi's advancement into the Anbu's ranks as
                a means of spying on the village. Itachi, however, knew an Uchiha coup would lead to intervention from
                other villages and ultimately start another World War, something he could not support. He instead became
                a double agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to the Third Hokage and the Konoha Council in the hopes
                it would help them find a peaceful resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Itachi shared the burden of betraying his clan with Shisui. But as time went on it became increasingly
                clear that peace could not be achieved. Shisui intended to use his Kotoamatsukami on the Uchiha's
                leaders to compel them to negotiate, but his right eye was stolen by Danzō before he had a chance. His
                own options exhausted, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi and begged him to protect the
                village and their family name before drowning himself in the Naka River. Itachi was anguished by
                Shisui's death, enough to awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan. When the following day some Uchiha, already
                suspicious of Itachi, accused him of murdering Shisui and staging a suicide, Itachi lost his composure
                and attacked them, defeating them easily. A rift was created between Itachi and his family, and his
                warnings to them to reconsider what they were doing fell on deaf ears. By age 13, he was promoted to
                Anbu captain.

            <p>
                Although the Third Hokage still wished to negotiate with the Uchiha, Danzō Shimura recognised that there
                was no longer an outcome that could see the Uchiha clan's survival. He explained this to Itachi and left
                him a choice: support the Uchiha's coup and have the whole clan, including Sasuke, killed in the ensuing
                conflict, or accept the assignment to wipe out the clan before the coup started and be allowed to spare
                Sasuke. Itachi chose his brother.Despite having made his choice, Itachi was tormented by guilt,
                especially with the knowledge that Shisui would most likley not forgive his choice to destroy the
                clan.However, remembering the words of his father to not let other's decide things for his life, he
                resolved to continue his path. While making final preparations, Itachi discovered a masked man sneaking
                around Konoha. From observing him, he came to believe the man was truly Madara Uchiha bent on provoking
                some new conflict. Itachi approached him with an offer: he would assist "Madara" with wiping out the
                Uchiha, taking vengeance against them for abandoning him decades earlier, if Madara would spare the
                village, to which he agreed.

            <p>
                In one night Itachi and Tobi slaughtered the entire clan. Itachi took it upon himself to personally
                execute his parents. Despite his betrayal, they bore him no ill-will, instead telling him in the moments
                before they were killed that they were proud of him and requesting that he take care of Sasuke.
                Racked by grief for his actions, Itachi saw in Sasuke the only person suitable to punish him for his
                crimes. In order to set Sasuke on this road he cast himself as the villain, done by allowing Sasuke to
                find him standing over their parents' bodies and using Tsukuyomi to torment him with visions of their
                murders. Sasuke fled, fearing his own death, but Itachi chased him down to divulge the lie he had
                concocted: he killed their family to test his mettle and now wanted to test himself against the only
                remaining challenge to him, the little brother he had never loved. He encouraged Sasuke to become strong
                enough to kill him and take revenge, and to that end suggested he acquire a Mangekyō Sharingan of his
                own. Itachi left, but was surprised to find Sasuke already pursuing him with a newly-awakened Sharingan.
                Sasuke's attempt at vengeance failed and he passed out, but not before seeing Itachi cry with
                remorse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Afterwards, he disguised a crow clone as a member of Root to threaten Danzō he would leak Konoha's
                secrets to enemy villages if he touched Sasuke, having realised Danzō could not be trusted to keep his
                promises. For his final business in the village, Itachi visited the Third Hokage and reported his
                mission completed, much to the Third's surprise and disappointment. Itachi requested that the Third look
                after Sasuke, which the Third vowed to do.[26] Itachi left the village publicly a traitor but secretly
                with a new mission: to infiltrate Tobi's organisation, Akatsuki, and keep it from moving against
                Konoha. In the anime, at some point after joining Akatsuki, he was initially partnered up with Jūzō
                Biwa. While growing accustomed to his new setting and working well with his partner, the duo was
                eventually given a mission in the Land of Water. After completing it, they were ambushed by a hunter-nin
                squad led by Yagura. While initially pressed by the perfect jinchūriki, Itachi was able to defeat him
                with Amaterasu, but not before Jūzō was slain.

            <p>
                Some time later, Orochimaru tried to steal Itachi's body in order to gain the Sharingan, but Itachi
                easily overpowered him, trapping him inside a paralysis genjutsu and severing his left hand to prevent
                him from dispelling it.In the anime, Itachi expressed his disgust at Orochimaru for his inhumane
                experiences and was about to kill him when Kabuto saved Orochimaru but they were both forced to leave
                Akatsuki. Later, Itachi was partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki, with whom he bonded over their shared
                notoriety for killing their own countrymen.To find a replacement for Orochimaru, Itachi helped
                recruit Deidara, whose art he defeated with his Sharingan's genjutsu; Deidara would forever after swear
                vengeance for the humiliating defeat.In the anime, Itachi also aided in the recruitment of Hidan.
                Pain eventually caught wind of Orochimaru's attempt to destroy Konoha and requested a team to
                investigate, which Itachi immediately volunteered for out of concern for Sasuke's safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with
                medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.
